# Project Documentation

## Overview

Our project currently runs using a local database setup. This means that to run the entire project, you'll need to:

- Set up a local PostgreSQL server for the front end.
- Configure the necessary settings in the backend folder.

*Note: We plan to implement Docker soon to streamline our setup and integrate the various components more efficiently.*

## Temporary Documentation

For the time being, this documentation is temporary:

- I will host the full documentation on GitHub Pages when possible.
